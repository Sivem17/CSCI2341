Decoder.txt
========================================
ProgramInfo

This program decodes a previously-encoded file and writes the plain text form
of the file to an output file. It requires two command-line parameters:

1. The first command-line parameter must be the name of the input file, and
   if the file is not in the current directory it may include the path to the
   file. This file will contain the encoded text to be decoded.

2. The second command-line parameter must be the name of the output file, and
   if the file is to be written to a location other than the current directory,
   it may include the path to the file. This file will contain the decoded
   plain text.

This program does not perform any error checks, so the user is responsible for
ensuring that both files named on the command line can be opened, and that the
first file is a properly encoded file of text to be decoded.
